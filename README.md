# ml_based_ff_parameter_optmztn

Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning framework for optimizing molecular force field parameters using quantum mechanical data. The system uses RDKit for molecular manipulation and feature extraction, along with scikit-learn for training predictive models that can generate accurate force field parameters.
Features

Automated extraction of molecular features from chemical structures
ML-based prediction of force field parameters (bond force constants, equilibrium bond lengths)
Integration with quantum mechanical data for training
Validation against established force fields (MMFF94)
Visualization tools for model evaluation and parameter analysis
